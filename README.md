# iplocation

This is a small script designed to make looking up the physical location of an 
IP address or hostname just a little bit easier.

To build this tool, run `go build` (you'll need to have Go installed).

To use, invoke `iplocation` with either an IP address or DNS address:

```bash
./iplocation 1.2.3.4
./iplocation google.ca
```
